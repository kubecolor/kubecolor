release:
  # Our "release.yml" workflow triggers when a release is created,
  # even as a draft, so that goreleaser can populate it later
  # and finalize the release.
  #
  # This allows us to do some hotfixing of our release pipelines
  # in case there were some bugs, as in the case of failure the
  # GitHub release is never published and the Git tag is never pushed.
