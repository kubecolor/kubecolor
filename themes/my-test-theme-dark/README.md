# KubeColor Themes

If you want to share your custom theme, please open a Pull Request and:
- explain in the PR what is the goal of the theme (Ex: simple esthetic, disability related, better efficiency to display informations,...)
- add a foder for your theme into the `themes` folder, and name it with name of your theme and either the `-dark` or `-light` suffix. Ex: `my-test-theme-dark`.
- a screen capture of the end result as `.jpg` or `.png`
- the `color.yaml` file that includes comments with:
  - your name
  - your email
  - the date of the last update

As maintainers we reserve the right to refuse any theme, whatever our reason is. If you don't agree, you are free to host your theme anywhere else.
