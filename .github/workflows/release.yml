    # Only run when a release is created, but not when it has been published.

    # Release process:
    # 1. you create a draft release
    # 2. this "release.yml" workflow gets triggered
    # 3. goreleaser builds binaries and pushes them as release artifacts
    # 4. goreleaser publishes the release (on GitHub, Homebrew, Docker, etc.)
    #
    # This allows us to have build errors on step 3. without us having to
    # roll back a release or artificially bump the version just because of
    # a CI/CD issue.
